First compile like this :

```javac Main.java```

Then run the program like this:

```java Main mul 10 20``` (does a multiplication, the russian way)

```java Main eu 146 46``` (finds the GCD with the euclides algorithm)

```java Main tri 5 2 7``` (tells you if 3 sides (a, b and c) can form a triangle, and if yes, it gives you its type)
